## Visual Design Document
A poor attempt at a visual definition document.

**Look and feel**. I want something a lot like Waze. Lots of single click icons, so that this is easy to use. The objectives are:
1. Minimize Input
2. Icon driven app
1. Rotating/Animating buttons
2. Transparent icons - Waze style
3.
