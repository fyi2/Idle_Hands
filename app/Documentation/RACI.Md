### Notes
- **Every logged in user** has the ability to create a disaster. ;-)
- Anyone can create an incident as they see fit. By default they become the incident manager, unless they designate someone else.
- Initiators and General Managers are by default super users
- Merging is giving. You can give your incident/disaster away but you can't take someone's incident/disaster
